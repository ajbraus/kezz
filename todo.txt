upcase beginnings of sentences in js
	found selector for this but don't know how to upcase the text 
		on load upcase the character and on all the sortable() update methods do it again.

Usecases:

I'm Tony the teacher 
	I log on to kezz to create kezz libraries to use as homework and in class exersices for my students
	I like the way that I can see each student's progress on their homework and comprehension (I see time taken to complete, # of submits, and # of hints). 
	I don't like that it is so easy for the students to cheat, one google search and they find the text and the answer, I guess even then they are at least reading it all the way through. I do get potential cheater stats if they submit only once and take no hints.
	I also like that I can find existing libraries and related libraries to what I teach.

I'm Sally the student
	I log into kezz because my teacher requires us to do some in class exercises and homework in kezz.
	I like it because I am a hand's on learner and because I improve and earn points and badges from my teacher and from the site. It makes doing my homework fun.

I'm Nikolai the Russian
	I log into Kezz to improve my english composition and reading comprehension. 

I'm Ian the investor
	I like kezz because it is a platform with many users and a proven model. I plan to buy it for oodles of money and wrap it into a giant soulless backward educational technologly corporation
