Usecases:

I'm Tony the teacher 
	I log on to kezz to create kezz libraries to use as homework and in class exersices for my students
	I like the way that I can see each student's progress on their homework and comprehension (I see time taken to complete, # of submits, and # of hints). 
	I don't like that it is so easy for the students to cheat, one google search and they find the text and the answer, I guess even then they are at least reading it all the way through. I do get potential cheater stats if they submit only once and take no hints.
	I also like that I can find existing libraries and related libraries to what I teach.

I'm Sally the student
	I log into kezz because my teacher requires us to do some in class exercises and homework in kezz.
	I like it because I am a hand's on learner and because I improve and earn points and badges from my teacher and from the site. It makes doing my homework fun.

I'm Nikolai the Russian
	I log into Kezz to improve my english composition and reading comprehension. 

I'm Ian the investor
	I like kezz because it is a platform with many users and a proven model. I plan to buy it for oodles of money and wrap it into a giant soulless backward educational technologly corporation
